# Ideas

- Comparison of Armor Sets
  - The tool should know which armor sets you have (which might overlap)
  - The tool should know what armor is in the vault
- Support for multiple exotics of different types: enforce single-exotic 
  constraint
  - The input needs to specific whether an item is exotic or not.
- Actions
  - `armor items [type]`: List available pieces of armor
  - `armor sets [name]`: List defined armor sets
  - `armor compare set1 set2`: Compare two armor sets
  - `armor analyze`: Analyze possible armor sets

## Needs

- Include EXOTIC vs. LEGEND in input file for each armor set.
- Need equals() for pieces of armor
- Need a way to define a named armor set in the armor file
- Need a way to easily add a piece of armor (?)
- Need a way to easily compare a potential set with existing sets
